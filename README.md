# Remote-Learning-Plus
This app will serve as a tool for professors and students alike to make a more enriching virtual classroom environment. This will provide professors several tools to make virtual learning more engaging, and at the same time help them more efficiently teach by automating processes like grading and attendance. The app will also provide students the ability to customize their virtual learning experience to suit what they need. Students will have the ability to not only view lectures, but to interact with professors and ask questions in an effective manner.
